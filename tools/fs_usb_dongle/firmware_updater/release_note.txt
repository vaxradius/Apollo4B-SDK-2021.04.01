DONOT re-enumerate USB when AP4 plug in/out(From IACT's requirement)
Fixed the reported issue on running kermit_transfer on macbook
Minor update for firmware version display in firmware_updater.py, versioned 1.3

2020-07-17 Release V6
SHA-1: e2c755aee3500e2ae38d912f7c5a8193c0949162

prevent USBH from sending data when busy doing setline/getline
--fixed the issue when run kermit_transfer on macOS

2020-07-14 Release V5
SHA-1: 7ff362b482287ee73e1b0265eab8c92908e86c1f

Minor update on firmware_updater.exe, versioned 1.3. Added factory default version handling.
(Factory default firmware may return 0xffffffff for MCU2 version when read, display same version as MCU1 with "(factory default)" instead of displaying "4294967295")

2020-07-07 Release V5
SHA-1: 4c966516a058d93a11d45efeb6b09587eb1d9cac

Fixed MacOS loopback test issue. MacOS tends to break longer data packet into smaller ones, this may cause Dongle host TX and RX at same time with Apollo4.
In such case, STM USB stack does not handle state machine correctly, added state protection code to avoid the issue.
Improved SPI communication stability.
Revised test script ap4_cdc_loopback_test.py for MacOS case.
Revised version number to all be displayed in decimal.


Known issues:
•	Get line commands
    Get line commands from PC are terminated at dongle, and not relayed to Apollo4. e.g. setting baudrate information will not be bridged to Apollo4.
•	Half duplex communication mode.
    The inter-MCU SPI communication on the dongle is half-duplex, and hence the expected USB traffic is also half-duplex. 

===============================================================================

2020-06-29 Release V4
SHA-1: de37c7c0f6d0f8a52f804b510fab7a4d697f500f

Apollo4 connection/disconnection status reported to PC host.
First 1.5sec after plugged into PC host, dongle will check for Apollo4 status. If not connected, dongle will enumerate as STM VCP device.
Otherwise, dongle will use Apollo4's descriptor information for enumeration.
Revised test and firmware_updater scripts to handle com port close when exception happens.
Added firmware reading command support in firmware_updater.exe

Known issues:
•	Get line commands
    Get line commands from PC are terminated at dongle, and not relayed to Apollo4. e.g. setting baudrate information will not be bridged to Apollo4.
•	Half duplex communication mode.
    The inter-MCU SPI communication on the dongle is half-duplex, and hence the expected USB traffic is also half-duplex.

2020-06-19 Release V3
SHA-1: cf4fd175df3bfd7d33666516f4f99ab86b975a9d

Updated MCU2 to allow continuous working when Apollo4 experienced a reset.
Improve stability:
    Removed HAL_Init() and SystemClock_Config() from application firmware and only call them in the bootloader.
    Prolonged MCU2 reset release time.
    Removed blocking code from MCU1 error handling.
Enabled set line command bridging.

Known issues:
•	Status update of Apollo4 USB
    The dongle does not report the status of a connection. If during operation, Apollo4 is unplugged from the dongle, leaving only dongle connected to the PC, the PC software may not know about this disconnect event.
•	Get line commands
    Get line commands from PC are terminated at dongle, and not relayed to Apollo4. e.g. setting baudrate information will not be bridged to Apollo4.
•	Half duplex communication mode.
    The inter-MCU SPI communication on the dongle is half-duplex, and hence the expected USB traffic is also half-duplex. 
•	Apollo4 device info not reported to PC (e.g. PID/VID)
    If PC software is checking PID/VID information of a device, it will only read PID/VID information of the dongle
•	VCP exception not handled
    If there is any unexpected VCP stop event, user may have to unplug and plug back the dongle to recover from the event.
    During our test, such "unexpected event" only happens when a key interrupt (ctrl+c) happens during test script running. If in user’s use case, there is no such event, there should not be any issues.

2020-06-18 Release V2
SHA-1: 5ef43de74498494ce4cfe04186daa52ddaa1d747

Fixed an issue when data up streaming.
Enhanced bootloader robustness against unexpected power loss.
    Added MCU option to bootloader flag page

Known issues:
•	Status update of Apollo4 USB
    The dongle does not report the status of a connection. If during operation, Apollo4 is unplugged from the dongle, leaving only dongle connected to the PC, the PC software may not know about this disconnect event.
